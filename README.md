# Fitness Timer Multicycle-Architecture
_Fitness Timer implementation using a Multi-cycle Architecture. It can set the routine time in minutes or seconds, has visual aids to stablish the start or end of each workout routine and intervals; each routine has a max of 1 hour duration, and the time runs in a countdown. Implemented in MIPS, Python and VHDL._

## Content
